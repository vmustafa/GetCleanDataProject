A. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGN

The raw data for this study is from the following publicly available dataset:-
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0)

Complete details of this study is available at the following url:-

A Brief about the study:-

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured and recorded.

Based on the raw data collected, the current project attempts to arrive at the mean values of such data & their standard deviations for each volunteer at each activity.

B. Naming convention used for features in this experimental study & this project

Based on the raw signals captured, the study estimates & records values of certain physical movement characteristics as well as it estimates & 
records certain statistical measures of these physical movement characteristics like mean(), median(), std(), etc. Overall, per record there are such 561 
features. Our project is concerned with the mean() and std() (standard deviation) measures only - 66 features.

The naming convention used in the experimental study is as follows:-
a - the physical movement characteristics are obtained from time (t) or frequency (f) domain. This forms the starting prefix for the feature.
b - this is followed by brief name of physical value being measured:-
    [BodyAcc,GravityAcc,BodyAccJerk,BodyGyro,BodyGyroJerk,
     BodyAccMag,GravityAccMag,BodyAccJerkMag,BodyAccJerkMag,BodyGyroMag,
     BodyGyroJerkMag]
c - this is followed by a '-' and the statistical measure being estimated:- like '-mean()' or '-std()'
d - further classification of the physical value in b (if any), separated by '-' :- like for axial classification (X,Y,Z) '-X', '-Y', '-Z'

For this project, a simplification is used in naming the features, which is described below:-
1 - Since we are concentrating on mean() & std() only so '-mean()' will be removed and by default the variable represents the mean of its measure.
2 - '-std()' will be replaced by '_sd' and it will form the suffix (last part of the name).
3 - the further classification (see d above) will follow the core physical value name. '-X' become 'X'
example 1:- tBodyAcc-mean()-Z becomes tBodyAccZ
example 2:- tBodyAccJerk-std()-X becomes tBodyAccJerkX_sd
This is the naming convention used in the cookbook in the next section.

D. SUMMARY CHOICES

Based on the raw info captured from the device, the experimental setup is able to estimate the mean & standard deviation of the physical characteristics and 
store them. Thus in each row of data - means and standard deviations of some physical characteristics are stored for a particular subject during a particular 
activity. Multiple rows of data are captured for a subject for a particular activity. 

First part of the project collates the info mentioned above from various sources into one data table - XTidy.

The second part of the project summarizes the data from first part to arrive at the average (or mean) values of physical characteristics for each subject & 
each activity combination. Since there are 30 subjects and 6 activities and all subjects have undergone all activities, there should be 30*6 = 180 rows.
